\section{Conclusion}
%this is a conclusion
Specific \bac\ choices can lead to successful establishment of an efficient carbon harvesting community.  Compared with \phy-only systems, \pbs s are having higher application potential in current industrial and commercial systems due to the multi-functional flexibility from \bac.  Further biological investigations are needed to choose appropriate candidates and optimise their biological features.  Our model can also be generalised and provide theoretical support to various microbial and environmental assessments.
