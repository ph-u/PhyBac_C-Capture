1. same exploration using py3
switch integrator of py3 using settings: LSODA, LSODE, LSODES
small number magnifying numerical error, once go negative can't go back
closer to boundary, more likely to unstable solve (confounding error)
2. parameter stability
3. converge solution analytical

stochasticity can take effect & cells easy to obtain, so small initial pop may not be meaningful
