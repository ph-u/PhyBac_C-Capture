relate harvest rate (cont) = harvest interval (destructive interval)
can change x but not others -- other graph
x2: interval of destructive harvest system
x = (carbon final - carbon initial)/days
compare cont & dest: chosen optimal x

same sample size ***
displaying correctly the variance
no discarding anything

feasibility vs sustainability
among feasible, which has more yield
can yield compensate feasibility

how hard to engineer -- when successful, how good is it?

next:
1. dest -- right & make sense
2. represent samples correctly
3. separate plot of x: cont & dest (intervals & rate of harvest)
4. show variance correctly
5. how system behaves can't control (x), can't control, optimal condition what x
6. x-axis in words
7. boxplot-type fig to answer each Q
8. y-axis: call "yield", no unit needed
9. motivation: clear that there's hardly any work on this issue

##### lab meeting #####
bumpiness
starting off with huge load of carbon
pre-treat sewage before feeding into the system

work more on detailed explanation of what refers to what
remove small dashed boxes, white boxes; can explain issues but can't capture the details
sensitivity vs biological realism
don't know that I found values from publications (range of literatures that I've searched, no need to name parameters in presentations)
wiggling lines: jumping in parameter space -- feasibility from sample sizes
confidence intervals can't use when sample sizes are not the same

need to minus initial?
understand raw data important
is it worth looking at eqm5? -- model mathematical feature
no need PBN & PoN -- model features, can't do anything
analytical non comparable with numerical
set integration days much lower (20K, 2000, 200: a magnitude of time)
weakness in the model
check diff in time scales in N-systems
