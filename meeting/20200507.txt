plot y-axis with manual limit (crashed systems)
why the python solver not same as R (ask Tom)
start system at stationary point 3%
evaluate C'(t) at the 3%
X: set of initial conditions converge C vs P, see whether they come to stationary point of not
max -xC from analytical solution Eqn2
- take eqn for B -> rearrange x as subject on B * eqn for C = harvesting term
- find B leading to max harvest (only B positive)
- plot xC vs x: cal x make B very small?
cal x for high& low cases, C (changing high/Low parameters)
