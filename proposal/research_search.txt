Dear James,

After some searches, I've found that the most relevant research group to my topic is based on University of Cambridge.  There is one professor in University of Oxford doing related research but no groups in ICL is working on the topic of "energy generation through ecology".

Links below this email are some urls pop-up during my search.

May I know whether I can email them for external supervision on my MRes project?  Or I can only share my idea with them to start an email conversation?  I am really excited because there are somebody doing researches that are so close to my idea!

Best,
PokMan
