max sustainable yield with para**
- all players still exist
- feasible or not
objective affect test conducted
feasibility vs stability
eqm position above 0
why feasibility is important

understand whether it is feasible at all
do i need bacteria to max carbon export? (compare that with/out bac)
simple vs complex system**
more organism harder to stabilise

what method max extraction
draw a cartoon

parameter ranges for MSY, what is MSY
measure of parameter space VS extraction rate (relate to: MSY gC/t)
- continuously available
- free parameter

whether increase recovery rate (integration)
