The new model quantitatively addresses the enhancement of carbon capture ability by \phy-\bac\ \pbs s.  Life history trait values of \phy\ and \bac, harvest mode and harvest rates have high importance in constructing such systems.  A \pbs\ with continuous harvest has a high expected carbon yield, although the chance of establishment is limited when trait values of \phy\ and \bac\ are unknown.  Further investigations on invasion resistance and practical deployment of a carbon capture co-culture are needed.  Climate change is serious and our society needs an effective carbon capture device urgently.
