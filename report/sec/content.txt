\section{Introduction}

Climate change is affecting not only the ecosystem, but also the human society \autocite{notz2016observed,schuur2015climate}.  Extreme weather, season regime shifts and tropical disease spread towards temperate regions have intensified at a terrified rate.  Although we know carbon emissions are major contributors \autocite{notz2016observed}, we need fossil fuels to power our cities and industries \autocite{ferguson2000electricity}.  How can we minimise or even revert the damages to our climate?

For decades, experts have proposed many methods to mitigate climate change by harvesting carbon from sources and the atmosphere \autocite{farrelly2013carbon,yang2008progress}.  These mitigation measures can be categorised into three groups: abiotic (chemical or mechanical) capture, land fertilisation and plantation.  However, these methods require lots of human effort, which means a lot of power and raw materials are used.  Eventually, this symbolises the extensive use of fossil fuels and is far from ideal.  The calculation method to estimate the overall benefits, carbon footprints and environmental damages within the lifetime of a device is called ``life-cycle assessment” (LCA).  Through LCA, not only the above mitigation measures do not have expected benefits, but also many renewable energies are not truly sustainable \autocite{abdussalam2020green}.  For example, manufacturing solar panels requires different chemicals and rare earth metals.  Material extraction, material delivery, panel assembly and all associated machines use a large amount of materials and power.  Hence the expected lifespan of the solar panel cannot cover all the environmental debt \autocite{martinopoulos2020rooftop}.  For a proper LCA, chemical pollution caused by the disposal of solar panels should be also taken into consideration.  Hence the only sustainable solution is to use the natural methods, which shines light on the use of phytoplankton \autocite{farrelly2013carbon}.

Phytoplankton can capture around double the amount of land plants \autocite{SCHLESINGER2013341} because plankton grow fast.  Plankton can also be bottled into different shapes \autocite{evanson_2019} due to their small size.  Although the solution sounds ideal, the phytoplankton carbon capture device is exposed in air and bacteria can invade into the system.  Hence we have to consider and mitigate the bacterial damages.  On the other hand, bacteria is useful.  Different types of bacteria are currently used in industries for pollution control \autocite{dash2013marine,naik2013lead}, medicine production \autocite{huang2012industrial} and electricity generation \autocite{songera2012electricity}.  If we can couple phytoplankton with bacteria, we can not only use the system for harvesting carbon but also to produce useful products for our society.  Coupling phytoplankton and bacteria is hence bear potentials for further investigations.

However, where to start?  Billions of phytoplankton and bacteria exist around the world and hence trial-and-error would take forever and be unaffordable.  In this case, we can seek for a simpler alternative by using mathematical models.  There are dozens of ecosystem models published in the past few decades.  Yet they are constructed based on nutrient cycles (nitrogen and/or phosphorus) in their respective project sites (Table \ref{modComp}).  So these published models do not fit our purpose because they cannot represent general phytoplankton-bacteria relationships and/or do not resemble the carbon flow within the system.  So to answer our question, we have proposed a new mathematical model.  The model simulates how carbon flows and recycles in a simple phytoplankton-bacteria system when we harvest carbon from it.

Using the model, we want to address three aims listed below.

Can bacteria coexist with phytoplankton without significantly changing the system’s maximum carbon harvest ability?  Carbon harvest in this context can be interpreted as either ``destructive harvest” or ``continuous harvest”.  Destructive harvest means we wait for some time, take down and replace the whole phytoplankton-bacteria system and extract all carbon content (total carbon) from the system.  Continuous harvest means we use some methods (e.g. filtration) to take a portion of organic carbon out from the ongoing system in regular time intervals (yield flux).  The question is targeted on organic carbon capture devices.  In those devices, a pure phytoplankton culture is used \autocite{evanson_2019} and hence bacterial invasion can potentially cause unexpected malfunctioning.  We would also want to apply the result in industrial bacterial cultures, like those for production of medicine and electricity.  The main reason is because this model can suggest whether adding phytoplankton as a carbon source for these bacteria would be beneficial for the environment.  If this is true, adding phytoplankton also means the factories do not need to buy sugar for the bacteria and thus bringing down their production costs.

Does a phytoplankton-bacteria system prefer destructive or continuous harvest?  As defined above, destructive harvest is taking all carbon content out from the stabilised system and replacing it with a fresh culture.  This method is experimentally supported by the production of bacterial cellulose, which a semi-continuous growth media replacement increases the product yield within the same period of time \autocite{aytekin2016statistical}.  However the production of harvestable dead cellular content in a stable phytoplankton-bacteria system is theoretically high because the death rate for both phytoplankton and bacteria are at their maxima.  So we don’t need to wait for a new system to grow to its stable position before destroying it for carbon.

Are biological features of phytoplankton and/or bacteria significantly affecting the system’s carbon harvest function?  For this question we choose one of the carbon harvesting systems with phytoplankton and bacteria as our model setting to look into how the biological features influence the carbon output from it.  In which we will see how theoretically resource usage efficiencies, growth rates and death rates influence the model’s ability to harvest carbon.  At the same time, we compare the effect of having bacteria in the system to estimate the expected impact or benefit by not excluding bacteria from phytoplankton cultures.  The result can also reflect on our current approach on choosing the ``right” bacteria for designated functions.  Currently industries usually design a recombinant bacteria and optimise its growth media for high productivity \autocite{dash2013marine,naik2013lead,huang2012industrial,evanson_2019}.  However the choice of bacteria is often the one we understand the most \autocite{huang2012industrial}, which may be not the best candidate for the job.  Understanding the effect of biological features might provide a window for further optimisation and hence levelling up the productivity by modifying its resource efficiency and/or other features with indirect influence.

In this study, we have developed a general phytoplankton-bacteria model that resembles a simple real-life situation.  This model is a set of ordinary differential equations (ODE) describing an open system (matter can flow into and out from the defined system).  Integrating the model can simulate a forward-time prediction of carbon densities stored in the system while solving the equation set analytically can pinpoint the stable position of carbon densities in the system.  The mathematical form and a graphical representation of the model is shown in the Methods section.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{The model}

This system contained two biological components (i.e. phytoplankton and bacteria) and three state variables of densities (i.e. organic carbon $C$, phytoplankton biomass $P$ and bacterial biomass $B$) under a standardised temperature range of \temp.  Both biological components received carbon from different sources but performed the same functions. Phytoplankton photosynthesized carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (an unlimited source) while bacteria consumed organic carbon from its environment.  Both phytoplankton and bacteria respired and leaked a fraction of the carbon obtained respectively and allocated the rest to its biomass; some of the biomass died and became organic carbon in the environment.  Organic carbon in the environment could either be consumed by the bacteria or harvested from the system.  In this study we had four major assumptions: 1. living conditions in the system was homogeneous spatially, nutritionally, carbon and light availability; 2. unlimited nutrient supply from the utilization of sewage \autocite{markou2014microalgal}; 3. high carbon density would not block light for phytoplankton; and 4. bacteria do not have preference on the type of carbon as its resource.  In short, this model had only one explicit environmental limitation -- living space for phytoplankton.

Equations were listed as the rate of density change of state variables (grams of carbon per metre cube per day, \dxdt).  Three state variables of densities, two sets of four biological parameters (one set for $P$ and another set for $B$) and one harvest rate parameter was included in this minimal carbon cycle model.

\begin{equation}\left\{\begin{array}{rl}
    C'(t) &= \ePR(1-\eP)\cdot\gP\cdot P +\aP\cdot P^2 +(\eBR(1-\eB)-1)\cdot\gB\cdot C\cdot B +\mB\cdot B -xC\\
    P'(t) &= \ePR\cdot\eP\cdot\gP\cdot P -\aP\cdot P^2\\
    B'(t) &= \eBR\cdot\eB\cdot\gB\cdot C\cdot B -\mB\cdot B
\end{array}\right.\label{eq:PBH}\end{equation}

In Eq.\ref{eq:PBH}, $C'(t)$, $P'(t)$ and $B'(t)$ were the rate of change of densities (unit \dxdt).  $\ePR$ was the fraction of non-respired carbon for $P$, $\eP$ was the fraction of carbon incorporated as $P$ biomass, $\eBR$ was the fraction of non-respired carbon for $B$ and $\eB$ was the fraction of carbon incorporated as $B$ biomass.  The above four unitless parameters were grouped as “fraction parameters”.  $\gP$ was the growth rate of $P$ (\dayU), $\aP$ was the intraspecific interference of $P$ (\denI), $\gB$ was the resource clearance rate of $B$  (\denI) and $\mB$ was the death rate of $B$ (\dayU).  These four were the “rate parameters”.  $x$ was the harvest rate (\dayU) which determined how fast the carbon in the environment got removed.  Below was the graphical version of our model.

\begin{figure}[H]

Dashed boxes were the defined boundaries, which the large box defined the open system for matter exchange, the box contained phytoplankton resembles the cellular boundaries of phytoplankton and the box contained bacteria resembles the cellular boundaries of bacteria.  Blue arrows indicated the direction of carbon densities flow from a resource pool to another.  Text above the arrows were the biological processes represented by the arrows.  Pink boxes represented the carbon density pools defined by the state variables, which were the states of which the carbon in the system could be identified.  White boxes represented the functional components of the biological components in the system.  Biologically the white boxes were the collection of all biochemical reactions within the whole population of organisms indicated in the text of respective boxes.}
    \label{f:model}
\end{figure}

Eq.\ref{eq:PBH} was simulating the setting of $B$ coexisting with $P$ under continuous harvest (PBH).  The full-geared model had three other alternative forms:

P-only with harvest (PoH);
\begin{equation}\left\{\begin{array}{rl}
    C'(t) &= \ePR(1-\eP)\cdot\gP\cdot P +\aP\cdot P^2 -xC\\
    P'(t) &= \ePR\cdot\eP\cdot\gP\cdot P -\aP\cdot P^2
\end{array}\right.\label{eq:PoH}\end{equation}

$B$ coexist with $P$ without continuous harvest (PBN); and
\begin{equation}\left\{\begin{array}{rl}
    C'(t) &= \ePR(1-\eP)\cdot\gP\cdot P +\aP\cdot P^2 +(\eBR(1-\eB)-1)\cdot\gB\cdot C\cdot B +\mB\cdot B\\
    P'(t) &= \ePR\cdot\eP\cdot\gP\cdot P -\aP\cdot P^2\\
    B'(t) &= \eBR\cdot\eB\cdot\gB\cdot C\cdot B -\mB\cdot B
\end{array}\right.\label{eq:PBN}\end{equation}

P-only without continuous harvest (PoN).
\begin{equation}\left\{\begin{array}{rl}
    C'(t) &= \ePR(1-\eP)\cdot\gP\cdot P +\aP\cdot P^2\\
    P'(t) &= \ePR\cdot\eP\cdot\gP\cdot P -\aP\cdot P^2
\end{array}\right.\label{eq:PoN}\end{equation}

Upon rearranging the variables in the above four system alternatives by SymPy (v1.5.1) in python3 (v3.7.3), we got six possible stable system states.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Table of equilibria from the four variations of the proposed model (Eq.\ref{eq:PBH})}
    \begin{tabular}{cl|ccc}\hline
        eqm & scenario & $C$ & $P$ & $B$ (only if scenario contained $B$) \\\hline
        1 & PBH, PoH & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        2 & PBH & $\dfrac{\mB}{\eBR\eB\gB}$ & 0 & $\dfrac{-x}{\gB(1-\eBR)}$ \\
        3 & PBH, PoH & $\dfrac{\eP(\ePR\gP)^2}{\aP x}$ & $\dfrac{\ePR\eP\gP}{\aP}$ & 0 \\
        4 & PBH & $\dfrac{\mB}{\eBR\eB\gB}$ & $\dfrac{\ePR\eP\gP}{\aP}$ & $\dfrac{(\ePR\gP)^2\eBR\eB\gB-\aP\mB x}{(1-\eBR)\aP\gB\mB}$ \\

        6 & PoN & - & P & - \\\hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{t:eqm}
\end{table}

Among all the possible states, only defined positive states were biologically possible because densities cannot be negative.  Equilibrium 5 and 6 were not defined; equilibrium 1 contained no biological meaning and equilibrium 2 was not biologically possible.  Hence we only had equilibrium 3 and 4 left, which resembled the setting of PoH and PBH respectively.

\subsection{Parameter space}
Not all defined parameters in our model had experimentally measured values.  Also, there was not a single species with published measurements on every biological parameter we defined.  Luckily there was at least one available value for each biological parameter in our model.  Hence in this study, we used a percentage range of known parameters to narrow down the unknown ranges of biological parameters with limited data and uniform prior to set sampling points within the parameter ranges of each biological parameters.  Ranges of each biological parameter was listed below and details of how we determined each biological parameter range was in the appendix.

        $\eBR$ & - & non-respired carbon fraction for $B$ & 0.13 & 1.00 \\
        $\eB$ & - & assimilated carbon fraction for $B$ & 0.07 & 0.82 \\
        $\gB$ & \denI & clearance rate of $B$ & 0.10 & 3.50 \\
        $\mB$ & \dayU & death rate of $B$ & 0.01 & 0.63 \\
    \hline\end{tabular}
    \label{t:ranges}
\end{table}

\subsection{Scenario sampling}
Within the parameter ranges using the uniform prior, we selected 11 values in the regular interval for each parameter using R (v4.0.2).  Next we randomly arranged the values for each parameter so that each parameter combination was unique.  This step was called a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS).  We repeated the LHS for 500 times to obtain a total sample size of 5500.  We also ensured each parameter combination was unique across the 5500 samples.  To ensure the study’s reproducibility, we had set the seed for random numbers to ``20192020”.

\subsection{Analytical determination of continuous harvest systems}
A series of discrete harvest rate values (1-12000 \dayU with 100 regular interval samples) were applied to scan for the yield flux in the PBH system using C (compiler gcc v7.5.0).  Then we refined the LHS scan with the same procedure mentioned above on the parameter space around the peak yield flux.  As yield flux was defined as $x\cdot C$ in Eq.\ref{eq:PBH}, yield flux of PoH systems were independent of harvest rate (Table \ref{t:eqm}).

\subsection{Numerical Integration of destructive harvest systems}
Feasible scenarios of the refined scan in the previous section were put into Eq.\ref{eq:PBH} and integrated using the ``odeint” function of SciPy (v1.2.3) in python3.  The initial densities (\den) were set as $C=P=B=1$ for PBN systems and $C=P=1$, $B=0$ for PoN systems.  The reason for using Eq.\ref{eq:PBH} for both systems is because Eq.\ref{eq:PBH} and Eq.\ref{eq:PBN} were equivalent when $x=0$ and Eq.\ref{eq:PBH} and Eq.\ref{eq:PoN} were equivalent when $x=0$ and $B=0$.  Time step was standardised to ``day” as above.  All state variables (i.e. carbon densities for $C$, $P$ and $B$) were summed at every time step divided by the number of time steps simulated in the model.  This averaged value was the equivalent of the yield flux in the analytical scan for continuous harvest.  Maximum yield for destructive harvest systems was mathematically the highest averaged system carbon content per day.

\subsection{Wrangling and analysis of top cohort carbon density yield fluxes}
Output from the analytical determination (continuous harvest systems) were carbon densities.  Hence we calculated daily yield flux by getting the product of harvest rate $x$ and the organic carbon $C$.  Output from the numerical integration (destructive harvest systems) was a time series of carbon densities.  Daily yield flux was calculated by the total carbon density in the system divided by the number of days (starting day is 1).  Since we would use a “wait and replace” procedure for destructive harvest systems, waiting days bore a sink cost expected to be recovered on the system replacement days.

Top 10\% yield flux of each system (PBH, PoH, PBN, PoN) was extracted and the maximum yield flux for each system was determined.  We plotted them with 95\% confidence intervals and performed a pairwise Wilcox signed rank test (in R) with bonferroni p-value adjustment and no paired situations to check on their difference in medians.

\section{Result}
Among the four settings, phytoplankton-bacteria coexisting systems with harvest (PBH), the former without harvest (PBN), phytoplankton-only culture with harvest (PoH) and the former without harvest (PoN), top 10\% high yield scenarios showed PBH system yielded significantly more than others with 95\% confidence under a standardised temperature range of \temp\ (Fig.\ref{f:ydByPara}).  Pairwise Wilcox test showed that all four settings have significant pairwise yield flux distribution from one another (p $<$ 0.01).  All groups only reached its maximum yield flux at minimal phytoplankton intraspecific interference rate.

PBH systems had limited parameter ranges on five of the parameters (i.e. $x$, $\ePR$, $\gP$, $\aP$ and $\eBR$) along the parameter range defined in this study.  With a median of 120.61 \dxdt) and an interquartile range (IQR) of [91.44-160.93] \dxdt, the group was the third in maximum yield flux (284.62 \dxdt) with the smallest sample size (n=326).  High harvest rate, high phytoplankton respiration fractions, low phytoplankton growth rate, non-minimal phytoplankton intraspecific interference and high bacterial non-respired carbon fraction made the system unfeasible.  Yield maximised at low harvest rate, high growth in phytoplankton biomass, density-insensitive phytoplankton death rate, mid-level carbon to biomass efficiency in bacteria, high bacterial growth rate and low bacterial death rate.

PBN systems had no parameter limitations across all parameter ranges.  Yet they yielded the worst in all scenarios.  With a median of 0.08 \dxdt and an IQR of [0.03-0.25] \dxdt, the group was also the last in maximum yield flux (246.28 \dxdt) with a moderate sample size (n=86538).  It had its maximum yield flux at very low harvest rate, moderately high phytoplankton non-respired carbon fraction, maximum phytoplankton biomass growth under high phytoplankton growth rate, moderately-high bacterial resource to biomass conversion efficiencies, high bacterial growth rate and moderate bacterial death rate.  

PoH systems had a median of 17.09 \dxdt and an IQR of [9.49-41.14] \dxdt.  The group had the highest maximum yield flux (345.75 \dxdt) with the largest sample size (n=110002).  Unfeasible scenarios occurred when phytoplankton had very low fractions of non-respired carbon ($\ePR$), low growth rates ($\gP$) and high intraspecific interference ($\aP$).  Fluctuations in yield on bacterial parameters were due to LHS sampling and extraction of top 10\% yield samples.  Yield maximised at very high harvest rate and high carbon to biomass fraction in high growth rate phytoplankton.

PoN and PoH systems behaved similarly in all parameter ranges although they were statistically different.  It had the same sample size with PoH (n=110002) and was the second-highest maximum yield flux (345.70 \dxdt).  Its median was 16.94 \dxdt\ and IQR was [9.43-40.99] \dxdt.  PoN had its parameter limits and maximum yield same as PoH systems except for the harvest rate parameter.  PoN has a slightly lower maximum harvest rate than PoH although their distributions overlapped.

\section{Discussion}
The model shows a general reality of possibilities in using a coexistence system of bacteria and phytoplankton to continuously harvest carbon from the atmosphere with a biological meaningful quantity.  We define eight biological parameters in this general model and use published experimental measurements to root the basis of the parameter ranges (Table \ref{t:ranges}).  Then we use percentage ranges from data collected for some parameters to apply on data deficient parameters of similar biological meaning.  The model captures a few commonly-known important interactions between microbes and its carbon source (Fig.\ref{f:model}).  With minimal parameters and minimal mathematical complexity, this ordinary differential equation (ODE) model should reflect a biological pattern with the use of real-life parameter values.

With real-life scenarios, we explored the effect of having bacteria coexisting with phytoplankton and/or continuous harvest of organic carbon from the system.  The result shows maximum daily carbon density yield can often be achieved by using the right combination of phytoplankton and bacteria.  Although phytoplankton-only systems are easier to be established and potentially having higher maximum yield than the coexistence system, our model shows that among the few right combinations (326 theoretical combinations of PBH systems under the LHS technique), much less external harvesting effort are needed to get a general high return (Fig.\ref{f:ydByPara}A).

Industrial production of biomolecules is a general interest in production maximisation.  Past studies on bacterial cellulose production showed material production by a pure bacterial culture can be maximised.  In the past few years a study established the experimental maximum to around 284 \dxdt\ \autocite{aytekin2016statistical}.  In the study they fed glucose to the bacteria.  Their system can be grouped into the destructive harvest system in this study.  They replace the bacterial culture and seed a new batch for material extraction.  If we apply changes from this model, theoretically a right phytoplankton can be put into the system and yield an average maximum of around 246 \dxdt.  In that case, the material cost for them can be cut by quite a fraction with similar material output.  By knowing the biological properties of the bacteria of interest, this model can also provide information on biological properties of the optimal phytoplankton choice and optimal extraction frequency within seconds.

For this study, we want to investigate whether bacteria can coexist with phytoplankton without significantly changing the system’s maximum carbon harvest ability.  Our result shows that if we are able to get the optimal combination of phytoplankton and bacteria, the PBH system is generally more productive than the others even with low external effort of harvesting (Fig.\ref{f:ydByPara}A).  However in terms of absolute maximum carbon harvest, addition of bacteria is always an disadvantage to the system.  The reason is because carbon fixed into organic form by phytoplankton can be released back to the atmosphere through bacterial respiration (Fig.\ref{f:model}).  Hence in short, an optimised PBH system is better suited than others within its feasibility limits.

However, the model also shows that if a phytoplankton-only system gets bacterial invasion, bacterial involvement can destroy productivity.  In the model, the P-only system resembles the PoN system in our model.  People usually put up the system to let it run for some time and replace the saturated system with a new one.  The bacterial invasion resembles a transition from a PoN to PBN system.  In Fig.\ref{f:ydByPara}, this transition has a top 10\% productivity median theoretical shift from 16.94 to 0.08 \dxdt.  If the phytoplankton is the best-fit one with invasion of the best-fit bacteria, the theoretical maximum still drops around 100 \dxdt, from 345.70 to 246.28 (Fig.\ref{f:ydByPara}).  On a different perspective, if the phytoplankton culture is designed to incorporate external harvest, which resembles the PoH system, then bacterial invasion might either be ecologically unfeasible (Fig.\ref{f:ydByPara}A, and the small feasible sample size of PBH under LHS scenarios) or increase the system’s productivity if bacteria suits the phytoplankton.  Unfeasible PBH means bacteria will be naturally eliminated and hence the system is ``resilient" towards invasions.  This situation shows the importance of considering external harvest in the initial design of ecological carbon capture devices.

Also, we want to explore for a phytoplankton-bacteria system, whether destructive or continuous harvest can maximise the carbon harvest.  Our result shows a clear support towards continuous harvest within feasibility limits.  Logically speaking, continuous harvest is a daily stable output from a mature carbon cycle within the phytoplankton-bacteria system.  On a contrary, biomass needs time to build up in a destructive system before the system gets replaced \autocite{aytekin2016statistical}.  In terms of the rate of cellular biochemistry, the rate is in its full theoretical potential under continuous harvest scenarios but not in destructive harvesting ones.  Therefore to reach high productivity in destructive systems, grow rates (Fig.\ref{f:ydByPara}D,H) and density-independent death rate (Fig.\ref{f:ydByPara}I) have to be higher than that in continuous systems.

On the last point we are curious about whether biological features of phytoplankton and/or bacteria can significantly affect the system’s carbon harvest function.  Our result shows that biological features of phytoplankton and bacteria affect the carbon harvest yield flux.  But only two of the parameters have unidirectional effect on the flux.  Among the feasible scenarios of PBH, $\ePR$ and $\gP$ have positive effects on the yield flux (Fig.\ref{f:ydByPara}B,D).  The flux increase for increasing $\ePR$ can be close to 100 \dxdt\ while that for increasing $\gP$ is around 50 \dxdt.  Limitations posed by the intraspecific interference (Fig.\ref{f:ydByPara}E) is the strictest, which only the minimal $\aP$ value can result in feasible PBH scenarios.  It shows that population size insensitivity is a major concern experimentally when identifying possible phytoplankton candidates.

Among all the nine parameters, death-related parameters ($\aP$ \& $\mB$) are hardly changeable under the current technology -- they can only be changed by choosing appropriate microbial candidates.  On a contrary, harvest rate ($x$) is the easiest to change according to needs because it is an external effort working on the system.  Phytoplankton growth rate ($\gP$) and bacterial clearance rate ($\gB$) are changeable with a number of associated factors \autocite{park2020potential}.  These factors may relate to many environmental and genetic factors such as temperature, media acidity, light intensities, metabolites concentration, carbon use efficiencies (i.e. $\ePR$ \& $\eP$ for phytoplankton; $\eBR$ \& $\eB$ for bacteria) and resource allocation to other cellular activities instead of biomass (such as environmental sensing).  For the group of factor parameters, they can be changed by genetic modification \autocite{moniruzzaman1996ethanol} but hard to be changed via growth media because of phenotypic plasticity \autocite{j1989respiration,bratbak1985phytoplankton,samejima1958heterotrophic} and interspecies coordinations \autocite{beliaev2014inference,amin2012interactions}.

%\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Strengths and Constrains}
The ordinary differential equation (ODE) model developed for this study is reflecting a general reality.  The model is general because it is spatial, temporal and temperature independent.  A minimal number of terms are used to describe a simple coupling system for one phytoplankton and one bacteria.  This system is ``real" because each parameter carry realistic biological meaning (Table \ref{t:ranges}) which is measurable through experiments.  The ODE only carries one mechanistic component, the intraspecific interference ($\aP$).  This allows users to generate testable hypotheses on phytoplankton-bacteria ecological relationships, for both intraspecific and interspecific aspects.  The system is also mathematically simple, enhancing readability and adaptability into more complex systems.  Complicated systems with multiple trophic levels can either use an enhanced version of this model or a set of generalised parameters to represent real system's autotrophic and resource cycling ability.

Since this study is a pilot theoretical study, blanketed assumptions (described in the first methodology subsection) are needed to initiate a testable model.  For example, many ecosystems have light and/or nutrient limitation(s).  Light attenuation and nitrogen availability in aquatic ecosystems are also common parameters in location-specific models which shapes temporal primary productivity and population distributions in water columns (Table \ref{modComp}).  In this study, we have assumed an unlimited resource supply except space.  This ideal state can be constructed through a continuous supply of nutrients to the system with a shallow water column to ensure light and nutrients can reach every part of the system.  On the other hand, these blanketed assumptions are testable null hypotheses.  With more observations on these nulls, they can either be falsified, restricted or kept.  Model variations can also be scripted based on different sets of environmental conditions.

Literature also reveal that some phytoplankton can reabsorb dissolved organic carbon from the environment \autocite{j1989respiration,samejima1958heterotrophic}.  Yet in this model we assume carbon only pass through phytoplankton in one-way direction (hence no reabsorption).  The purpose is to keep the model a minimalist fashion preventing overparameterisation.  The minimal model hence detaches phytoplankton's dependency on available carbon pool (Table \ref{t:eqm}).  Hence the role of phytoplankton in the model is a biological carbon pump to supply organic carbon to the $C$ pool (Fig.\ref{f:model}).

Parameter ranges in this study are not restricted by the described species.  It is beneficial in exploring biological possibilities yet fall short on realism.  As a result, there are no lists on the possible microbial candidates for the coexistence system.  The reason is due to the lack of biological data.  Most of the parameters (except phytoplankton growth rate $\gP$ and bacterial clearance rate $\gB$) can only be extracted from papers published decades ago.  Details such as environmental pH, oxygen availability and apparatus preparation hence cannot be standardised.  Bacterial clearance rate was modified from growth rates assuming these two quantities have an arbitrary linear relationship and growth rates of microbes (both phytoplankton and bacteria) have similar ranges.  For the data collected, there is no species with information for all four of its parameters (either for the set [$\ePR$, $\eP$, $\gP$, $\aP$] or [$\eBR$, $\eB$, $\gB$, $\mB$]).  Some bacterial data was also recorded as ``bacterial community" in the papers \autocite{cochran1988estimation}, making analyses only achievable in a community level.

\subsection{Applications and Future Directions}
%% theoretical and applicable
The first line of application is constructing carbon capture devices.  Because of the general reality nature, users can measure the parameters from existed microbes comply with its role in the system and have a quick glance on the feasibility of the proposed system.  Under the increasing risk of climate change \autocite{notz2016observed,schuur2015climate}, efficiency in both time and cost is generally preferred.

Further modification can also be incorporated into cathodes of microbial carbon-capture cells (MCC) \autocite{varanasi2020improvement,mohamed2020bioelectricity,neethu2018enhancement,pandit2012microbial}, by using the bacterial component as the electron generator.  Bacterial biomass density (the $B$ pool) can be mathematically translated into electric potential using statistical model-fitting.  Once the relationship is established, bioelectricity from MCC can be potentially maximised by modeling the potential candidates using this ODE.  In that case, MCC can further be elaborated into a microbial battery with continuous wastewater treatment \autocite{mohamed2020bioelectricity} and organic carbon harvest ability.

This flexible model can also be modified or generalised into different scenarios involving autotrophs and chemoorganotrophs.  For example, environmental impacts can be modeled by generalising the ecosystem-of-interest into overviewing parameters.  Consumers can be mathematically incorporated into other terms (such as the death rates of producers) \autocite{hurtt1996pelagic}.  Alternatively, a consumer equation can be explicitly plug into the model to enhance the compatibility to the site.  By integrating the ODE system, the ecological impacts can be better quantified in the environmental impact assessment (EIA).

Refer to the above subsection, this model assumes a one-way flow of carbon through the phytoplankton.  Yet literature shows some phytoplankton can reabsorb dissolved organic carbon as resource \autocite{j1989respiration,bratbak1985phytoplankton,samejima1958heterotrophic}.  Hence confirmation of whether reabsorption is common and/or an important factor among phytoplankton is needed, especially when the organic carbon pool is the sole carbon source for bacterial decomposer.  If reabsorption is important and common, that will significantly change the relationship of phytoplankton and bacteria from commensalism (this study) to competition \autocite{bratbak1985phytoplankton}.  Hence the equilibrium positions may be shifted dramatically.

Also, intraspecific interference is the density-dependent mechanism for phytoplankton to reach population stability \autocite{o2017unexpected,savage2004effects,allen2007recasting,bernhardt2018metabolic}.  In our model, bacteria only has a density-independent death rate.  Hence it will be crucial to investigate whether how important do bacterial density affect its death rate.  Furthermore, how will carbon capture ability be modified due to the population dynamics.

We also assumed all organic carbon in the system is one entity.  Hence the theoretical bacteria does not have preference on its carbon resource.  However different classes of biomolecules have varying nutritional values and handling difficulties \autocite{amon1996bacterial}.  So it is important to show whether carbon source preference by bacteria makes an impact on the yield flux and/or system carbon density.

To further complicate the issue, phytoplankton and bacteria communicate with biochemical signals \autocite{beliaev2014inference,amin2012interactions}.  In this study, we only assumed phytoplankton and bacteria are two discrete entities with carbon process as their major purpose.  However communication between these two entities will raise a question of ``how important do communication modify the theoretical carbon capture behaviour of the system as a whole".  There are also records showing nutrient limitation can induce bacteria switching nutrient its source to directly compete with phytoplankton \autocite{danger2007bacteria}.  This raises a question on how well do wastewater resembles an ``unlimited nutrient source" in reality.

\subsection{Temperature-standardisation}
The procedure included two parts.  Parameter values collected from literature were temperature-tagged.  For parameters with very limited data points, majority of the data were collected under \temp.  Hence this study chose 23\textsuperscript{o}C as the standard reference to investigate with the proposed model.

Growth rate data was obtained from ``BioTrait" database\autocite{della2013thermal}.  Six filters were applied to extract published aquatic microbial phytoplankton $P$ or bacteria $B$ species entries which were identified to species level.  The matched data set was further filtered to eliminate entries reported no growth because these records could not reflect the temperature effect using the Arrhenius Equation.

\begin{equation}
    A = A_0e^{-\dfrac{E_a}{k(T_C+273.15)}}
    \label{arrEq}
\end{equation}

which $A$ is rate standardised in data and $A_0$ is the standardisation constant with the same unit, $E_a$ is the activation energy with unit eV, $k$ is Boltzmann constant from Scipy (v1.4.1) package under unit eV/K and $T_C$ is the temperature of the organism measured from the data with unit (\textsuperscript{o}C).

Activation energies for phytoplanktons and bacteria are 0.32eV and 0.66eV respectively\autocite{regaudie2012temperature}.  Standardised rate unit in data was initially ``sec\textsuperscript{-1}" and the unit was re-standardised to ``\dayU" for this study (Fig.\ref{f:A0}).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../result/stdCst.pdf}
    \caption[Boxplot of standardised $A_0$]{Boxplots of $A_0$ for phytoplankton and bacteria with unit ``\dayU"}
    \label{f:A0}
\end{figure}

Temperature-standardised growth rates were calculated by time-standardised and respective activation energies mentioned above.  The resultant data hence was in the unit of \dayU under 23\textsuperscript{o}C.

\subsection{Phytoplankton growth rates data wrangling}
Percentage range of the temperature-standardised data was calculated by the deviation of rate extremes from the mean.  This range was also considered one of the candidates for rate parameters which did not have sufficient data (min data entries of 5) to construct their percentage ranges.

The parameter range was hence calculated by mean of the standardised phytoplankton growth rates $\pm$ percentage range of its own.

\subsection{Bacteria clearance rates data wrangling}
Temperature-time-standardised growth rate data from ``BioTrait" were not applicable directly due to the disagreement of units.  Clearance rate for microbes were also technically unfeasible to measure.  Yet these two quantities were related by the following linear relationship

\begin{equation}
    clearance \times resource\_density = growth
    \label{eq:gB}
\end{equation}

Due to the lack of data for resource density in literature collected by ``BioTrait" database\autocite{della2013thermal}, the only approach was using an arbitrary density (10 was used in this study) to resolve the unit issue.  The process was based on prior knowledge on cell size scaling of metabolism, so that the resultant ranges of growth rate is comparable between $P$ and $B$.

With data modifiable, percentage ranges of $\gB$ were calculated and parameter ranges were deduced using the same method mentioned above.  Its percentage range was also considered as a candidate for other similar parameters without sufficient data to construct a percentage range for its own.

\subsection{Parameter ranges for intraspecific interference of phytoplankton and death rate of bacteria}
Three and one data point(s) were available from reachable literature for $\aP$ \autocite{de2007biofixation} and $\mB$ \autocite{cochran1988estimation} respectively.  We chose the widest percentage range from available candidates in the same category for these rate parameters.  Percentage range of $\gP$ was hence selected as their reference range indicator in this study.  Their parameter ranges were calculated using the same approach explained in previous section.

For $\aP$ data collected from \autocite{de2007biofixation}, they were in 30\textsuperscript{o}C.  Although there was a temperature mismatch, they were still used because of no available data.  Hence it was assumed that the resultant parameter range could cover possible values in \temp.

\subsection{Non-respired carbon fraction for phytoplankton data wrangling}
Data was available in the form of linear equations in \autocite{j1989respiration}.  These equations from literature was temperature-tagged with y-axis as respiration rate and x-axis as growth rate.  Hence only the equations within the considered temperature ranges were accepted.  Among the six equations matched , intercepts and slope values were collected.

Using the growth rates for phytoplankton at 23\textsuperscript{o}C calculated, the non-respired fraction of carbon ($n(R')$) was deduced as

\begin{equation}
    n(R') = 1-n(R) = 1-\dfrac{\text{intercept}+\text{slope}\cdot\gP}{\gP}
    \label{ePReqn}
\end{equation}

Due to lack of matches between growth rate data and species available for these linear equations, the pool of parameter values were calculated by pairing every available growth rate with every available intercept-slope couple.  Percentage range was calculated and was considered as a candidate of reference range in the ``fraction" category.

Parameter range of $\ePR$ was calculated using the method described above but the maximum value was capped at 1 because in the proposed model it was assumed that P cannot absorb carbon from the C pool.

\subsection{Biomass assimilated carbon fraction for phytoplankton data wrangling}
Two papers were containing values with temperature matches.\autocite{j1989respiration,samejima1958heterotrophic}  Due to the assumption of ``no absorption of organic carbon from $C$ pool by $P$", these fractions were capped at 1.  Percentage range for this wrangled data pool was calculated and considered as a reference candidate for the ``fraction" category.

Parameter range of $\eP$ was calculated with the above method with maximum capped at 1.

\subsection{Non-respired carbon fraction for bacterial decomposer parameter range calculation}
$\eBR$ was calculated from Fig.1b and glucose recovery rate values of \autocite{cochran1988estimation}.  This paper was also the only publication with values associated with its respected parameter.  In the figure a net 100mg of carbon originated from straw material was recovered per gram of straw at around 24-28 days (from day 0).  At that period, the recovery rate of carbon released by respiration originated from external glucose was 80\%.  Since in the environment carbon source was either external glucose or straw, the respired carbon fraction is $\dfrac{100\cdot10^{-3}}{28\cdot(1-0.8)}$ and the non-respired carbon fraction is (1-[respired fraction]).

The calculated value was treated as the parameter mean and the percentage range of $\ePR$ was selected as the reference range for deduction of possible parameter range for $\eBR$

\subsection{Biomass assimilated carbon fraction for bacterial parameter range calculation}
The only data was embedded in \autocite{cochran1988estimation} and was treated as the mean of its parameter range.  Percentage range of $\ePR$ was selected as its reference range to deduce the range values.
