Samples were divided into categories by carbon removal rate.  W-test was carried out between eqm 3 (P-only) and 4 (P+B) comparing the ranked mean distribution differences.}}

\end{figure}

Fig.\ref{fig:wilcox} showed the W-test summary along the range of scanned removal rates ($x$).  No values were calculated for situations when $x=0$ because the organic carbon pool size was infinite for P-only systems (Table \ref{tab:eqm}).  Hence there was no valid comparisons using log values between P-only and P+B systems at $x=0$.  Generally increase in continuous removal decreased the carbon content and yield flux differences between P+B and P-only systems although the system differences remained statistical significant except when $x$ was around 0.3 to 0.4 day$^{-1}$.  At $x=0.4$ day$^{-1}$, the p-value was extremely high (p=0.79, 2dp).  The effects brought by the bacterial decomposer was not significant around that window of removal rates.

However for their  yield flux, P+B systems were significantly less (W=659181, p$\ll$0.01) than their P-only counterparts.  The dispersion for P+B systems were also smaller than that of P-only ones.}}

Fig.\ref{fig:v01} was a summary of 1013 simulations under the category $x=0.1day^{-1}$.  P+B systems were significantly higher than P-only counterparts in ``total carbon" (W=416686, p$\ll$0.01) but lower in ``carbon yield flux" (W=659181, p$\ll$0.01).  The 95\% confidence intervals of P+B and P-only systems did not overlap.  In the perspective of total carbon in systems, P+B and P-only systems had the most similar result in high phytoplankton growth rates ($\gP$).  For the yield

\subsection{total carbon}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 95\% distribution usually don't overlap between P+B \& P-only systems
    \item highest overlap occur in $g_P$ but at lower end the difference is much larger than when viewed from other parameters' perspectives
    \item overall distribution (left histogram) has similar peak size but still with statistical significance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{org-C / yield}
\begin{itemize}
    \item crossover in biological parameters are usually in lower side of parameter ranges (except $m_B$)
    \item more values of P-only systems $>$ P+B ones
    \item overall distribution (middle histogram) having P-only higher
\end{itemize}

However for their yield flux, P+B systems were non-significantly differ (W=541356, p$\approx$0.79) from their P-only counterparts.  The dispersion for P+B systems were also smaller than that of P-only ones.}}

\subsection{total carbon}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 95\% distribution mostly don't overlap between P+B \& P-only systems
    \item highest overlap occur at end of $e_{PR}$ and start of $a_P$ ranges but at the opposite ends the difference is high
    \item overall distribution (left histogram) is similar but still with statistical significance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{org-C / yield}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $e_P$ have P+B \& P-only systems almost overlapping each other
    \item $e_{BR}$ have P+B \& P-only systems crossing but neither ends are having high differences compared with distributions from other parameters' perspectives
    \item $g_B$ \& $m_B$ have P+B \& P-only systems with high difference at small values but as values increases both systems come close to each other and not showing big difference at high end of the range
    \item overall distribution (middle histogram) having different shapes (P-only having a long low-end tail) but they're not having statistical difference

\subsection{total carbon}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 95\% distribution don't overlap between P+B \& P-only systems
    \item highest difference happen in low $g_P$ and lowest difference in low $a_P$ regions respectively
    \item overall distribution (left histogram) has P+B distribution peaked on the right of the P-only one
    \item due to the stability in the P+B result (small 95\% interval on each solid line and across the 8 parameters), peak density of P+B higher than that of P-only
\end{itemize}

\subsection{org-C / yield}
\begin{itemize}
    \item log(yield)|$_{x=1}$ = log(org-C) + log($x$) = log(org-C)
    \item change of P parameters do not have observable effect on P+B log value (in smaller $x$ values fluctuated more)
    \item change of B parameters gave more consistent effect across parameter ranges
    \item most P+B values are higher than that of P-only
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $e_{PR}$, $g_P$, $g_B$ got (close to be) overtaken by P-only distributions
        \item $e_P$, $e_{BR}$, $e_B$ always had their distributions higher than P-only
        \item $a_P$, $m_B$ had P+B overtook P-only values at small parameter values
    \end{itemize}
    \item overall distribution (middle histogram) having P+B higher in central peak density; P-only has a wider spread in log carbon pool size
\end{itemize}
