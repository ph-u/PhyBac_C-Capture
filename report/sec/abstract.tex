%this is an abstract
\Bac\ are diverse.  \Bac l pure cultures contribute in wastewater treatments and medicine production.  Yet \bac\ invasion into \phy\ cultivation destroy the carbon yield.  Publications on plankton cultures focused on pure cultures cultivation and productivity, which did not account for \bac l-contaminated cultures outside laboratories.  Here we investigate the effect of adding \bac\ to a \phy\ system and harvesting carbon from that system.  We also investigate influences of biological features of both organisms on carbon yield.  So we developed a new model simulating carbon flow with one \phy\ and one \bac.  Our results showed three main points.  Destructive harvest is superior only when we cannot control over \bac l biology.  Continuous harvest gives resilience to \phy\ cultures towards \bac l invasion.  Carbon yield can largely be preserved in a \pbs\ when the optimal \bac\ was used.
