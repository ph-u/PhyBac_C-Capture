Modelling the feasibility of carbon harvest from a phytoplankton and bacteria system

## Abstract
"spoil"? -> paper
Bacteria are diverse group: problem and solution in different applications
too sudden: what's the problem & still a problem --> what I'm going to do
X: want to (sounds weak)  Here I investigate the effect of ...
"external harvest" --> every part appeal to noob reader
effect of adding bacteria a system & harvesting carbon from that system.
split up points, shorter & eplicit

X: aim
Here we look at how ... influ the yield of carbon from the system.

X: minimal -- undermining
ODE: too technical in abstract -> new model
carbon flow and harv

X: general model
investigate the possibility that crbon yield can be improved by coexistence between phy & bac as compared to pure phy
Note that what has been done
Previous work... study phy as their own for... However, such systems have ... problems --> what we're do to fix that

C yield varies substantially bio features of bac in these systems -> bac should be chosen along those lines
X: More investigations, On the other hand
not interesting: null

only talk about our own hypothesis
?1: little comtrol: destructive superior
?2: control biology: continuous superior

same logic flow in abstract, introduction, discussion
introduction: bg of previous work
cite closest papers with common element; novel combination of those things

say questions explicitly
X: simplicity & flexibility

just say results & points

## intro
X: the
have spread towards ... and
major contributors to ...
currently need fossil ...
hurting -> damaging
? into statement
exploit possiblte avenue to solve ... (set up position of reader; seeing why project is important)

Make the thing as subject, not people
releasing
split proposals into several points
There is a danger of... such as A, B, C

Make things subject =/= passive voice (not good)

cover too much ground, give some details
details best set up what project is about
expand "feasibility" -> Here I'm investigating the feasibility problem

remove some points that don't set up my project
deep and lead into the project, X superficial
It is essential to perform ... which estimating ...
LCA in discussion: how one needed & factors needed to be considered

amount of carbon ...
fast growth rate
system fluid-based can be a flexible size and shape
Phy carbon capture can be an ideal case but that suffers a problem, which...
One aim of this project is... effects of bac on these systems (shown and quantify that, and some bacteria can even enhance the system)
move bac points lower down
hint bac has potential positive effect, cite wastewater treatment (say they're not being used together)
