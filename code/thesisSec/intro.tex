  Oxygenic photosynthetic ability is granted by chlorophyll embedded within chloroplasts, and the majority type is chlorophyll-a (utilizing red light 680-700nm) and chlorophyll-b.  Yet, this energy ``red limit" has been extended by chlorophyll-d and chlorophyll-f.  Chlorophyll-d has photosynthetic response at 727nm while chlorophyll-f has activities recorded at 745 and 727nm.
  
  Assuming cyanobacteria lineages only differ by its ability to capture sunlight but not nutritional requirements,\autocite{giraldo2014plant} energy budget is the core focus of model.  The assumption is based on the widespread distribution of \Ss\ (or \As) globally\autocite{sawa2017electricity,joshi2018bacterial} and the tough survival ability tested for Mars terraforming (for \Cs).\autocite{baque2013boss}  Given that the living condition of \Ct\ is very different from others,\autocite{nurnberg2018photochemistry} it is expected that \As\ (or \Ss) have fitness advantage over \Cs\ under natural systems.  However the equilibrium position of the system under limited nutritional supplies in the button mushroom ecosystem\autocite{joshi2018bacterial} is unknown.
