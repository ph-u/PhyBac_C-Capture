vague research Q & hypotheses
stick with board ones first

bringing system stability -> more precise
this factor was affecting because of xxx
short paragraph for rationalisation right behind it
how likely hypothesis to be true/false
can be true but don't know yet, so it's worth to try

aim of investinging stability

too much jargon in first hypothesis
standalone hypotheses better

assumption paragraph -> overview paragraph in Methods

title: microbes; discussion: EIA
transects across some x & y axis
phase-based

eqmX vs x
check low-low, low-high, ... at four conors 
numerical instability
how settle into eqm point

sample of indevidual tragetory & integrate
cal at fixed aP, 2 lv + 2lv x

vary x & aP
integrate to get varying x & aP
result depend on aP? investigate x

NPBZ model not all have aP
sensitivity analysis: when is the limit not breakdown
main conclusion: harvesting, continuous extraction

biologically meaning of aP in interacting system

eqmA interesting
phase plane birafactation analysis

int system at four conors + middle (gP, gB)
ini around [0 0 0]
linearization: put system around eqm point
jaccovian matrix

contour fixed gP gB low-x low-aP
each contour: int low-x low-aP

############# lab meeting ####################################
meaning of max carbon when x=0 & x!=0
optimum parameter spaces when x=0 & x!=0
analytical = solving equations
numerical = integration

stable eqm -> stability analysis
phase-plane analysis: behaviour across parameter space
stability across time
