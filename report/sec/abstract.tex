Climate is changing due to the rapidly increasing atmospheric carbon content and we need an effective solution to capture and store these carbon.  Many carbon capture solutions have been proposed but we lack a consensus on which ones truly work.  One of these plans is to use a \phy-\bac\ co-culture to capture atmospheric carbon.  However only a handful of co-cultures are found suitable.  This study uses life history trait values to address the published observations of enhanced carbon capture ability in a few of \phy-\bac\ co-cultures.  To facilitate the search for carbon capture and storage, I have simulated the co-culture with a new mathematical model.  The model simulates the carbon flow in a system with one \phy\ and one \bacm, coexist using several life history traits under two different yield harvesting methods -- destructive and continuous.  Destructive harvest collects all carbon content in the system at once; continuous harvest filters out some organic carbon from the system daily.  The results show that \Rn{1}) feasible \pbs s have specific \phy-\bac\ requirements; \Rn{2}) continuous carbon harvesting makes feasible systems superior in carbon capture ability; \Rn{3}) feasible systems maximise carbon yield by maximising \phy\ and minimising \bac\ carbon-use efficiencies.  The results also provide a quantitative guide for future research on finding the optimal strategies to combine \phy\ and \bac\ for an effective carbon capture device to combat the current human-induced climate change.
