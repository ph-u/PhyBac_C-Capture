math struc, parameter, biological

why not parameter problem: Fig.4
why not model structure problem: ...

why do we care?
why is this important?

3rd Q -- define more

too detailed
no short-term in titles & bullet points
overview section -- main point, longer
subsection: questions to be tested, after introduction of the model

narrative: explaining what the field is missing IN WORDS
too many details the need ppl to look into other papers
ppl understand with only reading intro

2nd good -- LCA irrelavant
a bit softer tone
climate change, no "destabilisation"
state variable -- C,P,B
use common words

Ecology, *Ecology Letters, PLOS computational biology

3rd Q: not clear from title

### Methods
overview of the model: what did I do (end of intro)

capital letter in title, stay away from short-form
consistent term -- players
long-term in start of section

Fig.1: more in legend

lots of parameters
presenting the structures
present alternative forms
a full model with four alternatives

no cite standard packages unless it is specific methodology
right presentation method, multiple comparison error
if continuous trend -> line
if not continuous, no need that many box
colour more contrasting

### Discussion
longest part, longer than strengths
early discussion remind ppl about project
like "aims"

#########################
My result/simulation/experiment showed... productive than the P-only system[in terms of total carnbon content but not in yield flux.]
decrease length of each sentence
Discussion: not summary; relating to previous work, reasons why the result is the result
Tto C seq is sig higher
why is the point interesting
linking back to purposes
we want to find this, result is this and the reason is ...
compare system in like terms

look through graphs/text only and understand the whole result
misleading grey boxes
1st thing to show: for what proportion of parameter space getting stability (LHS, multi-axis space to show survive or not) -> restricting all settings within the feasible -> compare P-only when B go extinct, yield higher?
logic problem in graphics
make grey box a flux -> simulation (close to 99% eqm); wait for a certain time; not really even waiting until eqm

check inviable

look at graphs, explore viable para space PBH as function of parameters
explore destructive harvest: freq of destruction (per day/min/inf time) -> amount divided by time of development
fairly compare amount of carbon

max continuous harvest
if harvest optimally, what will you get? max flux along the axis of harvest
have optimin harvest rate --> property of that distribution along optimum harvest
distinguish var of parameter can't control, what portion of parameter can control -> optimise
