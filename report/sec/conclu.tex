Climate change is serious and our society needs an effective carbon capture device urgently.  This project quantitatively addresses the enhancement of carbon capture ability by \phy-\bac\ \pbs s.  The results show that harvest parameters and life history trait values of both \phy\ and \bac\ have high importance in constructing feasible systems.  A great way to proceed is to seek species with the optimal life history trait values accompanied by the right harvest parameters.  This study shows an alternative approach to explain the experimental observations of carbon yield enhancement.  It also expands the scope of the criteria searching for feasible \phy-\bac\ pairs to effectively capture atmospheric carbon.
