\subsection{Strengths and Constrains}
Selection of \phy, \bac, harvest mode and harvest rates are important factors in the engineering of an artificial carbon capture device.  \Phy\ living space is a major limitation hindering carbon yield under very high \phy\ growth rate.  This study is a pilot quantitative study addressing the observations of enhanced carbon yield by \phy-\bac\ co-cultures \autocite{fuentes2016impact,santos2014microalgal}.
