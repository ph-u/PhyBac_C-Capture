title: Carbon harvest maximised by a theoretical phytoplankton and bacteria system
Q: Is P+B better than P-only in C-harvest?
H.1: system with P+B harvest more than P
H.2: system with yield better than no yield C-harvest overall
H.3: biological features have significant impact on total C-harvest

H.1&2: 	two-way kruskal -> (P+B/P)vs(yield/no)
H.3: 	Wilcox -> each parameter

integration scan only the minimum final yield parameter sets (11 for P-only 14641 for P+B); and max?
- preliminary integration (integration on max & min of parameters) result showed that no shifting of equilibrium position in time series
- analytical scan showed gradual change of final carbon density
with total yield data, the three hypothesis can be tested
