Popular approaches in microbial co-existence system research

Key obstacles of microbial co-existence research
- no central direction
- manipulation of external environment but no mechanistic explanations of how things work
- the need of mechanistic models to highlight potentials

Review of recent mechanistic microbial ecology models

Ideas of a mechanistic co-existence model scattered in ecological models

Key elements vital to a mechanistic co-existence model (and why)
- efficiency of material uptake (non-respired carbon fraction, ePR | eBR)
- efficiency of biomass incorporation (eP | eB)
- growth rate (for unlimited resource, gP) / clearance rate (for limited resource, eB)
- death rate (density-dependence, aP | independence, mB)
- carbon harvest rate (x)

Parameter sensitivity analysis

Key challenges
- data availability
- data taxonomic bias
- experimental conditions non-standardised
- temperature ranges (thermal performance)
- indirect inference of some parameter values (especially for efficiencies)

Conclusion
- co-existence systems have the potential to be efficient and safe carbon capture devices
- currently lacking solid frameworks to investigate the potential
- this is a preliminary outline of an investigation direction
- some promising empirical proves have already published
- the observed phenomenon is mathematically sounded
- more research should focus on reporting life history traits of cultivable phytoplankton and bacteria
- life cycle analysis is important to determine useful implementations of co-existence systems
