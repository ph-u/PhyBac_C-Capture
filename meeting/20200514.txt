plot discrepancy situations, some +/-
possible causes of discrepancy: rate of change 0 when fixed, initial conditions
oscilating system -- discrepancy exist
face plane: some parameters rate change = 0
express discrepancy in %
find a reason for discrepancy: ini, num definitely right?
plug parameters in ode & num solve -> rate should be matching; eqm solution matching; plug eqm sol to start num solve again -> change==0
repeat rate & eqm tracing in both py3 & R
