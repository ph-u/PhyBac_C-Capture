A set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) were used to describe different part of the coexistence ecosystem of two cyanobacteria lineages \As\ (or \Ss) and \Cs\ ink-jet printed on button mushrooms.\autocite{joshi2018bacterial}  Assuming cyanobacteria lineages only differ by its ability to capture sunlight but not nutritional requirements,\autocite{giraldo2014plant} energy budget is the core focus of model.  The assumption is based on the widespread distribution of \As\ (or \Ss) globally\autocite{joshi2018bacterial,sawa2017electricity} and the tough survival ability tested for Mars terraforming\autocite{baque2013boss}
