Fig2: no continuous harvest; carbon yield without harvesting; name some things about the graph; Note that...; confidence interval; 0-20 days; phy one graph & PBN one; carbon pools in diff axis (comparison of systems / pools?)
interesting to discuss dropped initial

Fig3: coloured graph; units needed?; take highest yield harvest rate

negative yield should be separately shown

yield/days vs days
yield/days vs x

consistent throughout the thesis
