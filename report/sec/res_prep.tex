\section{Distributions}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{report/media/hist_PvsPB_A.png}
    \caption{Histogram of distribution on sustainable yield for total carbon in the system across the whole parameter space}
    \label{hist:A}
\end{figure}

Fig.\ref{hist:A} is the distribution of sustainable yield between the equilibrium position between phytoplankton only [P] and phytoplankton \& bacterial decomposer [P+B] set-ups.
\begin{itemize}
    \item both distributions are not normally-distributed $\rightarrow$ non-parametric test
    \item Wilcox-test: significantly different
    \item P+B $>$ P
\end{itemize}

Criticism: is the difference only due to the incorporation of bacterial biomass?
\begin{itemize}
    \item org-C: P+B $<$ P (Fig.\ref{hist:C})
    \item org-P: P+B == P (by eqm position calculation)
    \item org-B: P+B $>$ 0, P == 0 (by definition, P-only setting has no bacteria)
\end{itemize}
The figure not only indicated the effect by incorporating B, but also the reduction of org-C due to the carbon processing by B.  Yet the overall effect is still making P+B $>$ P in overall carbon in log-scale

    \caption{Histogram of distribution on sustainable yield for organic carbon pool across the whole parameter space}
    \label{hist:C}
\end{figure}

Criticism: why do the distribution in ``total carbon" choppy?

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{report/media/gBEffectOnOrgC.png}
    \caption{Plot of log organic carbon density against bacterial growth rate per unit organic carbon density ($\frac{m^3}{gC\cdot day}$)}
    \label{fig:orgCVSgB}
\end{figure}

From Fig.\ref{fig:orgCVSgB}, $\gB$ determined the result for organic carbon.  It is because the organic carbon fraction analytical solution is different between the two systems.  In equilibrium position 3, the organic carbon pool is totally related to parameters by phytoplankton while in co-existence solution the pool is completely relying on bacterial parameters.  Since in the parameter space scanning all bacterial parameters except $\gB$ has only one value (while $\gB$ is scanned with regular interval within a range), the distribution is logically deterministic and looks uniform and governed by $\gB$.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Table showing analytical solved possible equilibrium solutions from the ODE model}
    \begin{tabular}{c|ccc}\hline
        & C & P & B\\\hline
        eqm1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
        eqm2 & $\frac{\mB}{\eBR\eB\gB}$ & 0 & $\frac{x}{\gB(\eBR-1)}$\\
        eqm3 & $\frac{\eP(\ePR\gP)^2}{\aP x}$ & $\frac{\ePR\eP\gP}{\aP}$ & 0\\
        eqm4 & $\frac{\mB}{\eBR\eB\gB}$ & $\frac{\ePR\eP\gP}{\aP}$ & $\frac{\aP\mB x-\eBR\eB\gB\eP(\ePR\gP)^2}{\aP\mB\gB(\eBR-1)}$\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:anaSol}
\end{table}

\section{realistic parameter combinations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item yield flux (i.e.$xC$ term in equation, $\frac{gC}{m^3\text{day}}$) distribution:
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|ccccccccccc}\hline
        \% & 0 & 10 & 20 & 30 & 40 & 50 & 60 & 70 & 80 & 90 & 100\\
        approx flux & 0 & 1e-3 & 3e-3 & 7e-3 & 1e-2 & 2e-2 & 9e-2 & 0.5 & 1.8 & 6.1 & 3700\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
    \item unique parameter behaviour
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $x$ = 0 $day^{-1}$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item not in the maxed out yield under co-existence systems
            \item invalid using this model when considering P-only situation (as $x$ is at the denominator in eqm3-C density; Table \ref{tab:anaSol})
        \end{itemize}
        \item $\gB$ = 6.9e-5 $\frac{m^3}{gC\cdot day}$ is the only value causing maxed out yield
    \end{itemize}
    \item other parameters are having their whole range also included in this explosive output
    \item traditionally people only focus on research using fast growers (slow grower bring higher effect?)
\end{itemize}

If we eliminated this extremely low $\gB$ extracted from temperature-standardized BioTrait data, then the plot would become
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{result/MSY_SustainableYield_sySmall.png}
    \caption{Feasibility trend of comparison between P-only and P+B set-up}
    \label{fig:feasibility}
\end{figure}

And this figure shows that P-only set-up would be beneficial only if there is continuous artificial removal of organic carbon from the pool.  If minimal effort is expected (i.e. leave the system to run on its own), then a P+B system would have 100\% stability (no system breakdown within parameter range) with higher system carbon storage (Fig.\ref{hist:A}) and less visible ``black carbon" sediment (Fig.\ref{hist:C}).

    \begin{itemize}
        \item land use (space)
        \item nitrogen, phosphorus (nutrient)
        \item water use
        \item burn-in time
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item phytoplankton as anode, bacteria as cathode
        \item energy density up to dc 0.7V
        \item cell dry weight after 9 days up to 2.45g/L (MCC, 2018; i.e. 2.45kg/m$^3$)
    \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
summary:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the whole spectrum of sustainable yield (from 0.1 to 3000 g/(m$^3$day)) is logical
    \item biofuel production may not be an accurate reference level because it is a single species cultivation
\end{itemize}

\section{non-independent parameters literature search}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\ePR$ \& $\eP$ affecting $\gP$, and range of $\ePR$ used in the model was based on the range of $\gP$ under the same temperature range (from the paper which parameter values were collected)
    \item $\gB$ affected by nutrient type (from paper which $\mB$ value was collected) -- nutrient type is related to $\eB$
    \item no information in modelling papers: efficiency terms are not included in those papers; intraspecific competition term is at most addressed as an umbrella ``death term 2" which let models fit collected data
\end{itemize}
