target audience: experimental microbiologists
aim: give guidance on trait values that need to search for
flow:
1. consortia was having a few successful cases but there is no structured way to search
2. previously searches were done through genetics and/or phenomenological methods -> not a direct cause to the observation of enhanced carbon capture
3. a new model uses biomechanisms to explain the observations without the complex biochemical interactions reported
4. spatial effect may already be a crucial effect on the effect
5. a new insight on future searches: focus on life history trait values

species data don't exist -- more available data, more clearer picture
variability of parameter: stocastic / uncertainty
controllable parameters?
intraspecific variability (criteria to select) vs interspecific variability -- directional searchable?

thrown out data -- why non-feasible (feasibility %, keep top x percentile) -- fair number of data
source of data

<parameter range>
opinion paper? -- I believe this, here is my evidence...
paper -- my idea, initial go, idea for next
focus on journal features?
motivation of publishing, which paper/platform
