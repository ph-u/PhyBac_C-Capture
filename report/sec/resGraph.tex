    \caption[Median carbon content in destructive systems]{Median carbon content in destructive systems.  \textbf{(A)}, \textbf{(B)} and \textbf{(C)} show carbon densities in respective carbon pools since establishment.  Initial carbon densities for \PoN\ were [1,1,0]\den\ ($C$, $P$, $B$) and that for \PBN\ were [1,1,1]\den\ modeled from Eq.\ref{eq:PBH}.  Note that \PoN\ carbon accumulation was linear after establishment.}

    \caption[Yield flux distribution by harvest mode]{Log distribution of feasible scenarios on selected harvest interval/rates.  Unfeasible scenarios have caused some boxes represent a smaller sample size than the initial 5500.  Most boxes had a sample size of 5500, except \PBN\ day 50 (n=5454) and \PBH\ systems in \textbf{(B)} ($x$=100 \dayU, n=184; $x$=1000 \dayU, n=31; $x$=10K \dayU, n=3).  Note that \PoN\ day 0.5 in \textbf{(A)} was the only box with median significantly different (pairwise Wilcox p$\ll$0.01) from other \phy-only distributions.\lnExplain}

    \caption[Median daily carbon yield across systems]{Median daily carbon yield across systems.  \textbf{(A)} Yield changes for destructive harvest systems regardless of unfeasible data are treated as invalid (NA) or zeros.  \textbf{(B)} Log yield for continuous harvest systems with unfeasible scenarios is treated as invalid data.  Note that \phy-only systems have similar maximum yield for \textbf{(A)} \& \textbf{(B)}.  Also note that feasible scenarios has the highest median yield comparing to all systems \textbf{(B)}.\lnExplain}

Note that all parameters had significant influence on both \PoN\ and \PBN\ (Wilcox p$\ll$0.01 between extreme parameter values on both systems).  Also note that carbon yield in $\ePR$ and $\gP$ peaked at a high value (\textbf{A}\&\textbf{C}).\lnExplain}

    \caption[Log yield flux comparisons between feasible \pbs s]{Log yield flux comparisons between feasible \pbs s.  Note that \PBH\ feasible distributions were not continuous across parameter ranges with small number of scenarios (n=19) but yielded higher than that of \PBN.  Also note that all parameters had significant influence on both \PBN\ and \PBH\ (Wilcox p$\ll$0.01 between extreme parameter values on both systems).\lnExplain}
