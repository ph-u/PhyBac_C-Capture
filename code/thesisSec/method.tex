\section{Methodology}

The minimalist model used was composed by two players/ecological engines and three finite carbon pools (Fig.\ref{modelInWord}).  Photocells and bacterial decomposers were the two engines powering the interactions.  Both engines were sharing all but one different type of interaction, which is the carbon source.  Photocell gained carbon from the external unlimited carbon pool (i.e. $CO_2$) while
