phytoplankton & bacteria can sequester carbon
biofuel: algae
carbon sequestration: injection & others
bacteria as agents, general challenge
biocell machines with bactera presence

importance of C-seq
alt. methods
theo: model comparison, knowledge gap on C-seq
novelty: 3-parts system
compare similarities with diff fields

what doing
motivation
why doing

what original, biofuel vs C-seq

detritivore -> bacteria
detritivore -> decomposer
bacterial decomposer --> EIA

biotrait -> standardize temp, calculate P0, B0
temp correction

model to max carbon at one temp
