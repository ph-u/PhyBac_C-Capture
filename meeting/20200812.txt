abstract: sales pitch
clear before dig deep; reason -> question
general motivation for doing the project

showing proportion of feasibility (mean feaibility)
table, not text in showing data
remove 3rd panel

My result shows not single ; depending on what you achieve, whether we can control biology of bac

expected to talk about how cost, difficulty to scale up, potential problem
taken account constructing, maintaining... materials
if yield not high
bac doesn't change cost, only benefit side -- balance into making positive in LCA
c vs D subtly diff, account for future work

may able to find a fit bacteria from nature

discussion: are motivations justified
did we really related to geo-engineering?

in 1st discussion para: engineering with life
be clear it is not GEO, only engineering
messing with natural world
direct enginnering of bio-component
