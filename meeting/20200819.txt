Table 3: caption make sense of table standalone

Fig 4: legend in best place in each subplot
panel A shows yield as a function of harvest interval for destructive harvest scenarios. panel B shows... -> unfeasible treated as invalid data...
(B) what is showing: what they are
Note that the phy-only system numerical value is the same but cannot be seen due to the scales
have; compared
unfeasible scenarios were removed from this data

beyond the eqm density and dropped back to the same level
not sig-ly different
Median carbon yield for PBD dropped significantly from intervals (x1, x2 and x3)
harvest interval/rate that led to the max yield was dependet on the system
that max was diff across PoD ; similarly harvest rate
intervals depends on the system; rate also depends on the system
