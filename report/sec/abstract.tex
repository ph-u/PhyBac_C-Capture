\section{Abstract}
%this is an abstract
\Bac\ spoil many biological systems on a daily basis but they contribute a lot in several industries.  We want to investigate the effect of \bac\ and external harvest on a \phy\ system.  We also aim for looking at how biological features of both organisms influence the systems' carbon harvest ability.  Hence we developed a minimal ordinary differential equation model simulating carbon flow with one \phy\ and one \bac.  Through our general model, we reflect the possibility that the primary function of \phy, carbon harvest, can be largely preserved with \bac\ coexistence.  Our results show that through careful selection of \bac l biological features, can the \pbs s be modified into multi-functional cultures.  More investigations are needed to test how to implement such biological systems.  On the other hand, our simple model can be customised into different variations and generate testable null hypotheses.  The simplicity and flexibility grant interpretability to simulation results.  Hence our model can be modified and applied to different microbial and environmental assessments according to your needs.
