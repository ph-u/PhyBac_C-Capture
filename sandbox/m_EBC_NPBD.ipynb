    "NPZD model is a phenomenological ordinary differential equation (ODE) model in ocean science focus on describing the population dynamics of four major biochemical engines powering the oceanic carbon cycle system.  The nutrient pool (denoted by [$N$]) is consisting of inorganic nutrient essential for phytoplankton population growth.  Phytoplankton population (denoted by [$P$]) is assumed only one type of phytoplankton, grow by absorbing $N$ and is the food source of zooplankton (denoted by [$Z$]).  $Z$ is assumed only one type of zooplankton, food sources are including $P$ and detritus/organic matter (denoted by [$D$]) for its population growth.  $Z$ can only absorb nutrient through digestion of detritus into inorganic nutrient.  Due to the non-perfect absorption system, some \"digested but not absorbed\" inorganic chemical species can escape from zooplankton bodies and contribute to the $N$ pool.  For the $D$ pool, it is a collection of organic matter, including and mostly consist of cellular leftovers (i.e. dead cells from $P$ and $Z$).  It is a food source for $Z$, completing the microscopic oceanic carbon cycle."

    "Inspired by the EMPOWER model ([Anderson et al, 2015](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/382241/1/gmd-8-2231-2015.pdf)), I proposed a variation from the NPZD model, replacing the generalist $Z$ to a specialist bacteria _E. coli_ (denoted by $B$) which only feed on detritus.  In that case, $P$ and $B$ is not prey-predator relationship but indirect mutualists for nutrients ($P$ contribute to food source of $B$ and vice versa).  The aim for this model is to look at whether the population of $B$ and $D$ can grow so that $B$ population can produce household-scaled electrical power output and $D$ can be collected as a source of fixed carbon.  This ecosystem would be the anode part of the whole EBC, which the cathode part would be a Lactobacillus fermentation chamber.  This homofermentation chamber can also fossilize the fixed carbon from organic matter into irrespirable lactates, making it bio-unavailable to contribute as a greenhouse gas species naturally.  Yet as the chamber is not interacting with the oxic anode ecosystem, it is ignored in the EBC model."

    "This grazing pressure ($G_X$) equation is extracted from [Anderson et al, 2015](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/382241/1/gmd-8-2231-2015.pdf).  The term describes the predation pressure of zooplankton (Z) on phytoplankton (P) or detritus (D).  In the equation, $Z$ is the popoulation size of zooplankton, $P$ is that for phytoplankton and $D$ is for detritus.  $k_P$ is the half-saturation constant of P and $k_D$ is that for detritus.  $I_{Zmax}$ is the maximum ingestion rate of zooplankton.  The term orientation shows a positive relationship between grazing pressure linearly with predator $Z$ population size and their maximum ingestion rate.  This terms is also quadratically positive correlating with a fraction of food population and their half-saturation level.  This equation was having a slight algebraic rearrangement from [Anderson et al, 2015](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/382241/1/gmd-8-2231-2015.pdf), in which the term $k_Z$ was eliminated.  This shows grazing pressure is not hindered by the predator half-saturation level.  The grazing pressure was also inversely proportional to the sum of food descriptions plus one."

The incident irradiation is time-dependent ($t$), modified by the exponential term.  The exponential term is a difference equation ($k_{PAR}$) describing chlorophyll concentration ($C$, mg/m$^3$) and some experimental constants (i.e. $b_{0,i}$, $b_{1,i}$ ... $b_{5,i}$) from the site of interest.  This part is negatively correlated with depth, meaning lower light intensity (decreasing in exponential behaviour) would result from increasing depth ($z$).  It is also to pull phytoplankton population size with chlorophyll density through linear relationship estimation from [Randolph et al, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425708002022)\n",

It is experimentally found to be correlated to the maximum growth rate when environment temperature is 0$^oC$ and a constant to the power of environmental temperature $T$.  Growth is proved to be limited by nutrient and light availability.  Hence the growth rate is further modified by positively-correlating with nutrient population ($N$) and inversely-correlated with the half-saturation level of the nutrient ($k_N$) plus nutrient population size.  The product is further modified with the same parameter definitions but using the light intensity function to link phytoplankton bioavailable energy with light availability.  The $k_{I,t}$, however, is the maximum light intensity within the smallest scale of the model (default: day)."
