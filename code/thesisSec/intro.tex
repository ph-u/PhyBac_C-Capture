  Assuming cyanobacteria lineages only differ by its ability to capture sunlight but not nutritional requirements,\autocite{giraldo2014plant} energy budget is the core focus of model.  The assumption is based on the widespread distribution of \As\ (or \Ss) globally\autocite{joshi2018bacterial,sawa2017electricity} and the tough survival ability tested for Mars terraforming (for \Cs\autocite{baque2013boss}).  Given that the living condition of \Ct\ is very different from others,\autocite{nurnberg2018photochemistry} it is expected that \As\ (or \Ss) have fitness advantage over \Cs\ under natural systems.  However the equilibrium position of the system under limited nutritional supplies in the button mushroom ecosystem\autocite{joshi2018bacterial} is unknown.
