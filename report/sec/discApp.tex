%\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Strengths and Constrains}
The ordinary differential equation (ODE) model developed for this study is reflecting a general reality.  The model is general because it is spatial, temporal and temperature independent.  A minimal number of terms are used to describe a simple coupling system for one \phy\ and one \bac.  This system is ``real" because each parameter carry realistic biological meaning (Table \ref{t:ranges}) which is measurable through experiments.  The ODE only carries one mechanistic component, the intraspecific interference ($\aP$).  This allows users to generate testable hypotheses on \phy-\bac\ ecological relationships, for both intraspecific and interspecific aspects.  The system is also mathematically simple, enhancing readability and adaptability into more complex systems.  Complicated systems with multiple trophic levels can either use an enhanced version of this model or a set of generalised parameters to represent real system's autotrophic and resource cycling ability.

Since this study is a pilot theoretical study, blanketed assumptions (described in the first methodology subsection) are needed to initiate a testable model.  For example, many ecosystems have light and/or nutrient limitation(s).  Light attenuation and nitrogen availability in aquatic ecosystems are also common parameters in location-specific models which shapes temporal primary productivity and population distributions in water columns (Table \ref{modComp}).  In this study, we have assumed an unlimited resource supply except space.  This ideal state can be constructed through a continuous supply of nutrients to the system with a shallow water column to ensure light and nutrients can reach every part of the system.  On the other hand, these blanketed assumptions are testable null hypotheses.  With more observations on these nulls, they can either be falsified, restricted or kept.  Model variations can also be scripted based on different sets of environmental conditions.

Literature also reveal that some \phy\ can reabsorb dissolved organic carbon from the environment \autocite{j1989respiration,samejima1958heterotrophic}.  Yet in this model we assume carbon only pass through \phy\ in one-way direction (hence no reabsorption).  The purpose is to keep the model a minimalist fashion preventing overparameterisation.  The minimal model hence detaches \phy\ dependency on available carbon pool (Table \ref{t:eqm}).  Hence the role of \phy\ in the model is a biological carbon pump to supply organic carbon to the $C$ pool (Fig.\ref{f:model}).

Parameter ranges in this study are not restricted by the described species.  It is beneficial in exploring biological possibilities yet fall short on realism.  As a result, there are no lists on the possible microbial candidates for the \pbs.  The reason is due to the lack of biological data.  Most of the parameters (except \phy\ growth rate $\gP$ and bacterial clearance rate $\gB$) can only be extracted from papers published decades ago.  Details such as environmental pH, oxygen availability and apparatus preparation hence cannot be standardised.  Bacterial clearance rate was modified from growth rates assuming these two quantities have an arbitrary linear relationship and growth rates of microbes (both \phy\ and \bac) have similar ranges.  For the data collected, there is no species with information for all four of its parameters (either for the set [$\ePR$, $\eP$, $\gP$, $\aP$] or [$\eBR$, $\eB$, $\gB$, $\mB$]).  Some bacterial data was also recorded as ``bacterial community" in the papers \autocite{cochran1988estimation}, making analyses only achievable in a community level.

\subsection{Applications and Future Directions}
%% theoretical and applicable
The first line of application is constructing carbon capture devices.  Because of the general reality nature, users can measure the parameters from existed microbes comply with its role in the system and have a quick glance on the feasibility of the proposed system.  Under the increasing risk of climate change \autocite{notz2016observed,schuur2015climate}, efficiency in both time and cost is generally preferred.

Further modification can also be incorporated into cathodes of microbial carbon-capture cells (MCC) \autocite{varanasi2020improvement,mohamed2020bioelectricity,neethu2018enhancement,pandit2012microbial}, by using the bacterial component as the electron generator.  Bacterial biomass density (the $B$ pool) can be mathematically translated into electric potential using statistical model-fitting.  Once the relationship is established, bioelectricity from MCC can be potentially maximised by modeling the potential candidates using this ODE.  In that case, MCC can further be elaborated into a microbial battery with continuous wastewater treatment \autocite{mohamed2020bioelectricity} and organic carbon harvest ability.

This flexible model can also be modified or generalised into different scenarios involving autotrophs and chemoorganotrophs.  For example, environmental impacts can be modeled by generalising the ecosystem-of-interest into overviewing parameters.  Consumers can be mathematically incorporated into other terms (such as the death rates of producers) \autocite{hurtt1996pelagic}.  Alternatively, a consumer equation can be explicitly plug into the model to enhance the compatibility to the site.  By integrating the ODE system, the ecological impacts can be better quantified in the environmental impact assessment (EIA).

Refer to the above subsection, this model assumes a one-way flow of carbon through the \phy.  Yet literature shows some \phy\ can reabsorb dissolved organic carbon as resource \autocite{j1989respiration,bratbak1985phytoplankton,samejima1958heterotrophic}.  Hence confirmation of whether reabsorption is common and/or an important factor among \phy\ is needed, especially when the organic carbon pool is the sole carbon source for bacterial decomposer.  If reabsorption is important and common, that will significantly change the relationship of \phy\ and \bac\ from commensalism (this study) to competition \autocite{bratbak1985phytoplankton}.  Hence the equilibrium positions may be shifted dramatically.

Also, intraspecific interference is the density-dependent mechanism for \phy\ to reach population stability \autocite{o2017unexpected,savage2004effects,allen2007recasting,bernhardt2018metabolic}.  In our model, \bac\ only has a density-independent death rate.  Hence it will be crucial to investigate whether how important do bacterial density affect its death rate.  Furthermore, how will carbon capture ability be modified due to the population dynamics.

We also assumed all organic carbon in the system is one entity.  Hence the theoretical \bac\ does not have preference on its carbon resource.  However different classes of biomolecules have varying nutritional values and handling difficulties \autocite{amon1996bacterial}.  So it is important to show whether carbon source preference by \bac\ makes an impact on the yield flux and/or system carbon density.

To further complicate the issue, \phy\ and \bac\ communicate with biochemical signals \autocite{beliaev2014inference,amin2012interactions}.  In this study, we only assumed \phy\ and \bac\ are two discrete entities with carbon process as their major purpose.  However communication between these two entities will raise a question of ``how important do communication modify the theoretical carbon capture behaviour of the system as a whole".  There are also records showing nutrient limitation can induce \bac\ switching nutrient its source to directly compete with \phy\ \autocite{danger2007bacteria}.  This raises a question on how well do wastewater resembles an ``unlimited nutrient source" in reality.
