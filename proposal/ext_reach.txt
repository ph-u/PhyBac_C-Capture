Dear Prof. Smith,

Sorry for the interruption.  I am PokMan Ho, a current MRes student at the Imperial College London (ICL).  I am writing for sharing an idea and potentially further contacts.

The idea I have is how we can build a minimal artificial ecosystem which generate D.C. electricity and sequester carbon from the atmosphere.  This idea is largely align with the “biophotovoltaic” aspect in your lab, which I hope my first email can lead to further discussions in the near future.

Currently the thesis project was supervised by Dr. James Rosindell (cc’ed in this email).  The temporary idea for my 9-months dissertation project is to investigate whether such minimal artificial ecosystem is theoretically possible by building a computer model.  The aim is to search for possible ingredient combinations and potential time for achieving ecological equilibria.  I was supported to reach out for opportunities getting this project cosupervised by an external expert.

It would be a great opportunity if I am allowed to discuss more on this topic under the urgent threat of climate destabilization.  Thank you very much for your time.

Yours sincerely,
PokMan
