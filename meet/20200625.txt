g_P = max growth rate of P
acknowledge we can't follow CO2 dynamics
SymPy computational issue: eqm6 should have C as "-"
future work focus more on more complex carbon balance

JR
look back at papera: upwelling / land model
model equation from zero, CP model & limit P: P absorbing some C

fine without this component

SP
graphs are almost final
can do writing
biofuel model, individual-based, optimal mixing
modification of biofuel idea: carbon pool
meaningfully extend nutrient to carbon pool

EC
nutrient deplete version
dissolved organic carbon / DOM models
