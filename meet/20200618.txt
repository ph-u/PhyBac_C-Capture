4 extraction rate, 4 histogram
reasonable distribution from mean = found value
scale error as percentage of mean
coefficient of variation as error

independent estimate
take mean & Gaussian? sampling; observation error / process variation / sampling error
fix var proportion for sampling data
sp-dep par: present sp-wise simulations

take random data & normal dist with var related to the random data point
random draw from each parameter
latin hypercube sampling: random draw combination with equal number of times (sudoku)

cumulative yield sensitive to initial value
sustainble harvest more important

1. parameter change, unit issues
2. model exploration
3. sustainable yield analyses

*******************
1. solve P-only system analytical solution
2. gB: clearance rate for bacteria
growth rate = gB*C
gP = gMax/(half-saturation-const+substrate_conc)
gP as a function of nutrient (in report only)

literature search on model
get gB based on growth rate gB*C
should not need substrate conc to determine reasonable range of gB
get rMax from gB*C
