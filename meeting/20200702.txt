hypothesis should have stronger rationale
rationale paragraph not flow nicely
frame hypothesis as questions instead of now
decide between yield / harvest
no big theories to support -> a Q instead?

reader understand once read the hypothesis

H1:
Y P+B sustainable yield
definition of "sustainable yield"
greater max sus yield than P-only
additional of bacteria will increase sus yield

H2:
standardise terminology
more based on logic of my system -> more physically closer
analogous to grasslands
destructive harvest < continuous/constant harvest
maximum yield, not "sustainable"
total yield, same time frame
integrate for some time -> when same with x=0

this graph is hypothesis sorted
why presence of bacteria allows higher sustainable yield
diff between sustainable vs feasible -- now unfair comparisons
