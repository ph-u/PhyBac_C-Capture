sinking rate and bac react
DOM vs POM pool?
single POM particle
ability to process term

loss term in equation?
steady removal more realistic way -- ecosystem leakage
eqm solution given removal

bio-retionale of harvesting (why need to harvesting)
substitution of data into cal steady state solution & simulation

try solutions, convergence
positive solution: perturb eqm solution
meaningful max carbon pool in eqm solution (condition of max)
how to max other players
X optimal harvesting

biofuel literature: harvesting term
writing up
