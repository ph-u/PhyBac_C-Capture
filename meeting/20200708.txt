math struc, parameter, biological

why not parameter problem: Fig.4
why not model structure problem: ...

why do we care?
why is this important?

3rd Q -- define more

too detailed
no short-term in titles & bullet points
overview section -- main point, longer
subsection: questions to be tested, after introduction of the model

narrative: explaining what the field is missing IN WORDS
too many details the need ppl to look into other papers
ppl understand with only reading intro

2nd good -- LCA irrelavant
a bit softer tone
climate change, no "destabilisation"
state variable -- C,P,B
use common words

Ecology, *Ecology Letters, PLOS computational biology

3rd Q: not clear from title

### Methods
overview of the model: what did I do (end of intro)

capital letter in title, stay away from short-form
consistent term -- players
long-term in start of section

Fig.1: more in legend

lots of parameters
presenting the structures
present alternative forms
a full model with four alternatives

no cite standard packages unless it is specific methodology
right presentation method, multiple comparison error
if continuous trend -> line
if not continuous, no need that many box
colour more contrasting

### Discussion
longest part, longer than strengths
early discussion remind ppl about project
like "aims"
