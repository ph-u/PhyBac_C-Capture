%this is an abstract
\Bac\ are diverse.  \Bac l pure cultures contribute in wastewater treatments and medicine production.  Yet \bac\ invasion into \phy\ cultivation destroy the carbon yield.  Publications on plankton cultures focused on pure cultures cultivation and productivity, which did not account for 1. \bac l-contaminated cultures outside laboratories; 2. the effect of adding \bac\ to a \phy\ system and harvesting carbon from that system; 3. influences of biological features of both organisms on carbon yield.  A new model simulating carbon flow with one \phy\ and one \bac\ is developed for above aims.  Our results showed 1. destructive harvest is superior when \bac l biology is uncontrollable; 2. continuous harvest gives resilience to \phy\ cultures towards \bac l invasions; 3. carbon yield can largely be preserved when the optimal \bac\ was in a \phy\ culture.
